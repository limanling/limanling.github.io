      <description>&lt;p&gt;Event extraction from massive multimedia data enables us to obtain a large number of historical events.
These historical events imply knowledge about event interactions, which guides our predictions as to
what might happen next and what events are missing. For example, after an ATTACK event there will
usually be ARREST and SENTENCE events. We refer to this knowledge as Event Schemas, which can
be viewed as &amp;ldquo;complex event templates&amp;rdquo; that encode knowledge of stereotypical event structures and
show the progression of event evolution. However, previous event schema induction work has been
oversimplified to be local and sequential, rendering them incapable of dealing with real-world events
with numerous participants, complicated timelines, and various alternative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research tackles this issue with a new paradigm of event schema knowledge: an Event Graph
Schema, which is a graph-based schema representation that encompasses events, arguments,
temporal connections and argument relations. Figure 1 shows an example schema of the complex event
type car-bombing: a person learns to make bombs, purchasing materials and a vehicle; a bomb is fixed to
the vehicle; and the attacker drives the vehicle to attack people. In this scenario, people can be hurt by
the vehicle or by the bombâ€™s explosion. It is the first application of graph generation to induce event
schemas and predict future events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work is a new step towards the semantic understanding of inter-event connections. Different from
traditional methods using one-hop relations as connections between events, I learn a complicated graph
including temporal dynamics and multiple paths involving entities (coreferential or related arguments)
that play important roles in a coherent story. Compared to traditional schemas, my new paradigm of Models as Schemas add predictive power to produce multiple hypotheses with probabilities, along
with structural justifications for participant-specific and attribute-specific connections.&lt;/p&gt;
