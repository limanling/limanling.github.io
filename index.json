These historical events imply knowledge about event interactions, which guides our predictions as to what might happen next and what events are missing. For example, after an ATTACK event there will usually be ARREST and SENTENCE events. We refer to this knowledge as Event Schemas, which can be viewed as “complex event templates” that encode knowledge of stereotypical event structures and show the progression of event evolution. However, previous event schema induction work has been oversimplified to be local and sequential, rendering them incapable of dealing with real-world events with numerous participants, complicated timelines, and various alternative outcomes.\nMy research tackles this issue with a new paradigm of event schema knowledge: an Event Graph Schema, which is a graph-based schema representation that encompasses events, arguments, temporal connections and argument relations. Figure 1 shows an example schema of the complex event type car-bombing: a person learns to make bombs, purchasing materials and a vehicle; a bomb is fixed to the vehicle; and the attacker drives the vehicle to attack people. In this scenario, people can be hurt by the vehicle or by the bomb’s explosion. It is the first application of graph generation to induce event schemas and predict future events.\nMy work is a new step towards the semantic understanding of inter-event connections. Different from traditional methods using one-hop relations as connections between events, I learn a complicated graph including temporal dynamics and multiple paths involving entities (coreferential or related arguments) that play important roles in a coherent story. Compared to traditional schemas, my new paradigm of Models as Schemas add predictive power to produce multiple hypotheses with probabilities, along with structural justifications for participant-specific and attribute-specific connections.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f2e56be30ef26828327efa8e31f0c9a7","permalink":"https://limanling.github.io/researchsummary/reasoning/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/researchsummary/reasoning/","section":"researchsummary","summary":" Challenge: Long-Horizon Temporal Dynamics My Solution: Establishs a new paradigm of Models as Schemas to add predictive power to produce multiple hypotheses, along with structural justifications for participant-specific and attribute-specific connections","tags":["Knowledge Reasoning"],"title":"Think: Long-Horizon Dynamics","type":"researchsummary"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"d9a357a04b2ba9cb696186292def0042","permalink":"https://limanling.github.io/researchhighlights/m2e2/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/researchhighlights/m2e2/","section":"researchhighlights","summary":" Manling Li*, Alireza Zareian*, Qi Zeng, Spencer Whitehead, Di Lu, Heng Ji, Shih-Fu Chang\n- Opens up a new research direction of event-centric multimedia information extraction - Multimedia knowledge extraction is a new paradigm for information extraction, and has been well-noticed by the research community ","tags":["Extraction"],"title":"Cross-media Structured Common Space for Multimedia Event Extraction","type":"researchhighlights"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One of the main bottlenecks of large corpora analysis is the multi-document encoding. Whereas existing studies have built text graphs by augmenting text sequences with different hidden structural information, they are typically entity-centric and overlook the events’ intra-structures (arguments) and inter-structures (event-event connections).\nMy solution is using event graphs to provide a new comprehensive representation and necessary inductive bias. I propose to define the multi-document joint representation as the contextualized embeddings of the nodes on the event graph and collectively model events and arguments. These event graphs can then be used to address the massive unstructured data challenge in real-world applications: (1) Timeline Summarization is formulated as an event graph compression problem and then I design time-aware optimal transport to obtain the summary graph. (2) Meeting Summarization leverages agenda-based topics to segment meeting transcripts, and takes advantage of multi-modal sensing of the meeting environment, such as cameras to capture each participant’s head pose and eye gaze. (3) Multimedia News Question Answering employs multimedia event graphs to condition synthetic question-answer generation, and to automatically augment data via weak supervision.\nMy work is the first study to use event graph representations to overcome fundamental challenges in handling massive unstructured data that exist in various applications.

Grading:\nWeekly Reading 20pts in total Submit a paragraph for one paper each week. Mid-Term Exams 30pts in total Openbook exam, about open-end questions regarding three papers. Term Project 50 pts in total, 8pts project proposal (5pts report, 3pts lightning talk), 12pts mid-term project report (8pts report, 4pts milestone presentation), 30pts final project report (20pts report, 10pts presentation). The instructor will give 10 topics for the students to choose from. Students are expected to do self-teaming and each team should consist of 3-6 students. Everyone is encouraged to submit papers based on the term projects. Project score will by default be the same for all team members, but some team members can get a higher or lower score than the team score based on individual performance that is assessed in two ways: (1) checking contribution to final deliverables (e.g., Git commits and Final Project Report), and (2) Instructor and TAs’ opinion from project presentations.
