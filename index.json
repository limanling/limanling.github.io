Challenge: Multimodal Semantic Structures My Solution: Opens up a new direction of multimodel event extraction, to construct a multimodal common semantic space that preserves event semantic structures","tags":["Knowledge Extraction"],"title":"Read: Complex Multimodal Semantics","type":"researchsummary"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Event extraction from massive multimedia data enables us to obtain a large number of historical events. These historical events imply knowledge about event interactions, which guides our predictions as to what might happen next and what events are missing. For example, after an ATTACK event there will usually be ARREST and SENTENCE events. We refer to this knowledge as Event Schemas, which can be viewed as “complex event templates” that encode knowledge of stereotypical event structures and show the progression of event evolution. However, previous event schema induction work has been oversimplified to be local and sequential, rendering them incapable of dealing with real-world events with numerous participants, complicated timelines, and various alternative outcomes.\nMy research tackles this issue with a new paradigm of event schema knowledge: an Event Graph Schema, which is a graph-based schema representation that encompasses events, arguments, temporal connections and argument relations. Figure 1 shows an example schema of the complex event type car-bombing: a person learns to make bombs, purchasing materials and a vehicle; a bomb is fixed to the vehicle; and the attacker drives the vehicle to attack people. In this scenario, people can be hurt by the vehicle or by the bomb’s explosion. It is the first application of graph generation to induce event schemas and predict future events.\nMy work is a new step towards the semantic understanding of inter-event connections. Different from traditional methods using one-hop relations as connections between events, I learn a complicated graph including temporal dynamics and multiple paths involving entities (coreferential or related arguments) that play important roles in a coherent story. Compared to traditional schemas, my new paradigm of Models as Schemas add predictive power to produce multiple hypotheses with probabilities, along with structural justifications for participant-specific and attribute-specific connections.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"f2e56be30ef26828327efa8e31f0c9a7","permalink":"https://limanling.github.io/researchsummary/reasoning/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/researchsummary/reasoning/","section":"researchsummary","summary":" Challenge: Long-Horizon Temporal Dynamics My Solution: Establishs a new paradigm of Models as Schemas to add predictive power to produce multiple hypotheses, along with structural justifications for participant-specific and attribute-specific connections","tags":["Knowledge Reasoning"],"title":"Think: Long-Horizon Dynamics","type":"researchsummary"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"d9a357a04b2ba9cb696186292def0042","permalink":"https://limanling.github.io/researchhighlights/m2e2/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/researchhighlights/m2e2/","section":"researchhighlights","summary":" Manling Li*, Alireza Zareian*, Qi Zeng, Spencer Whitehead, Di Lu, Heng Ji, Shih-Fu Chang\n- Opens up a new research direction of event-centric multimedia information extraction - Multimedia knowledge extraction is a new paradigm for information extraction, and has been well-noticed by the research community ","tags":["Extraction"],"title":"Cross-media Structured Common Space for Multimedia Event Extraction","type":"researchhighlights"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"One of the main bottlenecks of large corpora analysis is the multi-document encoding. Whereas existing studies have built text graphs by augmenting text sequences with different hidden structural information, they are typically entity-centric and overlook the events’ intra-structures (arguments) and inter-structures (event-event connections).\nMy solution is using event graphs to provide a new comprehensive representation and necessary inductive bias. I propose to define the multi-document joint representation as the contextualized embeddings of the nodes on the event graph and collectively model events and arguments. These event graphs can then be used to address the massive unstructured data challenge in real-world applications: (1) Timeline Summarization is formulated as an event graph compression problem and then I design time-aware optimal transport to obtain the summary graph. (2) Meeting Summarization leverages agenda-based topics to segment meeting transcripts, and takes advantage of multi-modal sensing of the meeting environment, such as cameras to capture each participant’s head pose and eye gaze. (3) Multimedia News Question Answering employs multimedia event graphs to condition synthetic question-answer generation, and to automatically augment data via weak supervision.\nMy work is the first study to use event graph representations to overcome fundamental challenges in handling massive unstructured data that exist in various applications.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
